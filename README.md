NOTE: This project has been halted and now continues on the mini-apps project: https://github.com/Sergie-AGA/Mini_Apps

<<<<<<< HEAD
Current code version: 2.0 (under development)
Live version on Github pages: 1.1.1

Here you will be able to find web pages designed for different types of businesses and with a multitude of web technologies so you can get inspired and hopefully learn a few neat tricks.
The CSS of the project was made with SASS (SCSS more specifically), as well as the BEM naming convention and a reduced version of the 7-1 architecture. The Javascript implemented uses some of the modern ES6 features.

Updates:  
2.0 Now being developed.
Link to Mini-apps added;
Description mentions if the code is available on the repository;
@supports text now closable.

1.2: Removed placeholder projects and added personal portfolio. Expanded "more resources" section. Added text that appears if client's browser does not support some features.

1.1.2: minor tag adjustment in the form in "manage global"

1.1.1: Changed array of projects to become based on JS classes, being now more clean. Added a way to access the first project and included it to the array

Version 1.1: First actual project, "Manage Global" has been included. Minor text fixes implemented. Restructured folders copied 1.0 to a place of its own to enable version history in the site in a future implementation.

Version 1.0 is now live
The current version is only a basic template with the core functionalities implemented, but the existing projects are only placeholders for the future content that will be created.
